# Build Todo app in Golang with JWT, sendgrid and mongoDB

A todo app that signs up users, logs them in, creates their profile & manage their tasks.


## Running Locally

Setup your .env file locally to hold the keys required by the app

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/anikkatiyar99/todo.git
$ cd todo
$ go build -o test -v 
$ ./test
```

The application should be available and running on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
